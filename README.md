A hack by David Han, Shrey Mahendru, and Jesse Gleave Riemann. Originally conceived for UofT Hacks 2016.

Our hack, Prune (formerly PhotoBang), targets the problem faced by smartphone users of all demographics: Gallery Clutter. Every day, millions of blurry, accidental, or poorly captured photos are taken. These waste valuable storage space and are a headache to manually remove.

Prune is a simple application to help declutter your gallery, like a farmer picking out the bad apples from his tree. We use computer vision to quickly analyze and accurately classify these sub-optimal pictures, then present them in a simple, clean interface for the user to quickly scan through and delete as they see fit.

Also included is an optional "accidental screenshot" parameter which highlights screenshots.

With Prune, cleaning your phone has never been easier!
